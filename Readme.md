# Main features:
Nextauth Authentication: The Nextauth Library is used to facilitate the integration of different authentication providers (such as Google, Github, or even a custom login with email and password).Nextauth also supports JWT -based authentication.

JWT Validation: After login, a JWT token is generated and stored.This token is used to validate the user's subsequent requests, ensuring that only authenticated users have access to certain pages or resources of the application.

Route Protection: With JWT validation, routes can be protected to allow only certified users to access restricted areas (such as a dashboard).
